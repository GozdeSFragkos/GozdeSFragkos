<p class="has-text-align-left p1">I am a <b>data analyst/scientist and researcher</b>, passionate about using my data analysis and programming skills to contribute to the field of environmental science and the humanitarian sector. </p>
  
<p>After completing my Ph.D. degree at the University of Geneva in 2017, I started working as a research assistant at the interface of Astrophysics, Statistics, and Data Science at the University of Geneva. I have <strong>9 years</strong> of research experience in data-intensive fields in international working environments (<strong>Harvard University</strong>, <strong>University of Geneva</strong>). My research involved analyzing large datasets by using various advanced numerical tools, modeling, and image processing.</p>

<p>I am passionate about using my data analysis skills in the environmental, humanitarian fields, and health sector. I am interested in intellectually stimulating projects based on innovative ideas and new technologies to improve the quality of life and public health.</p>

<p>Having advanced hands-on Python for data analysis and programming skills I will present my projects here.</p>

<p>Being new in Github environment, I will start by putting one of my recent codes about marketing analysis that I prepared for a job interview. Soon, I will be putting some other projects on environmental and humanitarian data.</p>
